# weather_app

1) The core dart file can be found [here](https://github.com/mdkostom/WeatherApp/blob/main/lib/weather_app.dart) in lib.
2) I was unable to upload build folder due to it's sheer size. Let me know if it's needed or perhaps the dart file + dependencies are enough.
3) This is how the application looks like:

The problem however is that it does no offer any results. I am not quite sure what I am doing wrong, as I did follow the JSON documentation on open-meteo.com

At this point I think I'm required to make a weather_data.dart with conditions to refer to, as per suggestion of one of my classmates. But there is not enough time so I am unable to try and see if that is the element I am currently missing.

Please let me know if there are any suggestions you may have and what is critically wrong here. Thank you!
